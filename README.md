Hangman
deployed application: https://lenelow.github.io/hangman/index.html

This is a hangman game that uses nothing but HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The user has to guess the letters of a coding-related word, and has nine opportunities to guess an incorrect letter before losing the game. The hardest part for me was JavaScript, since I had just begun learning it when I started this project. Making a hangman game turned out to be much more difficult than I expected, but I'm glad I did it and I'm proud of how it turned out!

FEATURES
bronze:
    1) When the 'Play Hangman' button is clicked:
        a random word is generated from an array of words
        the word 'Ready?' and the 'Play Hangman' button disappear and are replaced with the random word with an underscore representing each letter 
    2) contains a form in which the user can input only one character
    5) user input is compared to the random word's letters, and underscores are replaced with correctly guessed letters on screen 
    6) incorrectly guessed letters are displayed on screen
    7) player's guesses are counted
    8) 'GAME OVER' message appears when the player loses(guesses incorrectly ten times) and 'YOU WIN' message appears when the player wins
    9) contains instructions on how to play the game

FEATURES I WANT TO ADD: 
    1) input is restricted to letters
    2) div that disappears when play button is clicked fades more slowly
    3) music plays when player wins/loses
    4) tracks wins/losses
    5) use canvas to draw hangman as wrong letters are guessed

TECHNOLOGIES USED
    1) HTML5
    2) CSS3
    3) JavaScript
